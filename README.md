And you are done!You can now run various simulations. The input is scale free one and is generated internally. You only need to input the number of agents you want in your simulation.

You also plot the result of simulation at different stages of simulation(one iteration of dimulation is 1 year of life) using PLOTGUI and save the graph as well.

Resource files can be found in  `src/main/resources/` along with saved graphs.
